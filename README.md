## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Important Note for Local Development

If you are **cloning this project** to use it on your local system, make sure to:

- **Rename the file:**  
  `src/app/Page.tsx` â†’ `src/app/page.tsx`  
  (The filename must be all lowercase: `page.tsx` for Next.js to recognize it as a route.)

Otherwise, the app will not run locally and you may see a 404 error.
