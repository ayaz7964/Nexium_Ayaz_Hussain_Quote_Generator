# Quote Generator ✨

This is a **Quote Generator** web app built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). It fetches and displays random inspirational quotes with a clean and modern UI. The project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

👉 **Live Demo:** [https://nexium-ayaz-hussain-quote-generator.vercel.app/](https://nexium-ayaz-hussain-quote-generator.vercel.app/)

## ⚠️ Important Note (For Local Setup)

If you are **cloning this project to run it locally**, make sure to:

✅ **Rename the file:**

src/app/Page.tsx ➝ src/app/page.tsx

> This is required because Next.js treats `page.tsx` (with a lowercase `p`) as the valid entry point for routing in the App Router.

Otherwise, you can simply view the working app through the [live demo](https://nexium-ayaz-hussain-quote-generator.vercel.app/).
