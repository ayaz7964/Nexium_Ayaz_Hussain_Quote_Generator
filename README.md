# Quote Generator ✨

This is a **Quote Generator** web app built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). It fetches and displays random inspirational quotes with a clean and modern UI. The project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## ⚠️ Important Note (For Local Setup)

If you are **cloning this project to run it locally**, make sure to:

✅ **Rename the file:**


> This is required because Next.js treats `page.tsx` (with a lowercase `p`) as the entry point for routing in the App Router.

Otherwise, you can simply view the working app through the [live demo](https://nexium-ayaz-hussain-quote-generator.vercel.app/).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install```

src/app/page.tsx

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [next/font](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
